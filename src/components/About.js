				Outdoor Connection is a group for adult women that enjoy getting
				together for hiking, athletic walking, participating in races, camping,
				and additional fitness or outdoor activities. Originally founded in 2007
				as a group for walkers, we have morphed over the years to include more
				hiking and a variety of other outdoor activities. Many of our activities
				are right here in town! If you like spending time outside, getting in a
				good workout, and making new friends you will enjoy this group.

				We are based in Dallas Texas. We visit many trails around the DFW area.
				Some of our favorites include White Rock Lake, Cedar Ridge Preserve,
				River Legacy Park, Northshore Trail at Lake Grapevine, Eagle Mountain
				Lake, and more. We walk both paved trails and natural surface hiking
				trails. Occasionally we head out of town for a day hike or campout at
				one of the nearby state parks. We may also schedule additional types of
				outdoor, fitness, or social activities.

				Outdoor Connection began initially as a walking group. Over the years we
				added hiking, then more outdoor activities. We are open to most
				activities that involve exercise and socializing outdoors - hiking,
				camping, kayaking, biking, etc. We are currently growing and looking
				forward to new activities. Members choose which events they want to
				attend. You can view our calendar to get an idea of what we do. New
				events are added on a regular basis. (The full details of the events are
				only revealed to registered members.)
